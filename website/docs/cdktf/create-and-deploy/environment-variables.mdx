# Environment Variables

These are all environment variables that you can use to configure the behavior of CDKTF.

## CDKTF_DISABLE_PLUGIN_CACHE_ENV

If set to `true` or `1`, CDKTF disables the [plugin cache](/cli/config/config-file#provider-plugin-cache). Otherwise, CDKTF creates the required plugin cache directory in `~/.terraform.d/plugin-cache` if it is not already present.

## CDKTF_HOME

If set overwrites where CDKTF stores cache and configuration files, defaults to `~/.cdktf`.

## CHECKPOINT_DISABLE

If set to a not-empty value, no [telemetry](/cdktf/telemetry) will be send.

## CDKTF_LOG_LEVEL

Can be set to one of the following values:

- `all`
- `debug`
- `info`
- `warn`
- `error`
- `fatal`
- `off`

It controls how much debug information gets printed to the console.

## CDKTF_LOG_FILE_DIRECTORY

If set to a path of a directory a log file (`cdktf.log`) will be created in that directory containing debug level logs.

## TERRAFORM_BINARY_NAME

If set you can overwrite the Terraform binary to use. If it's not set the terraform binary in path will be used.

## TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKEN

If set this token will be used to authenticate against Terraform Cloud, it needs to be set to a valid [Terraform Cloud API token](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens).

## http_proxy or HTTP_PROXY

If set this proxy will be used for all HTTP requests.

## DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK

If set to `true` or `1`, no version check will be performed. If it is not set we will verify your installed library version matches the CLI version and warn if they do not match.

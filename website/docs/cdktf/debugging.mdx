# Debugging

## Increasing the verbosity

To get more information about what CDKTF is doing and what problems have occured by setting the `CDKTF_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG`. If you want to share the logs you can set `CDKTF_LOG_FILE_DIRECTORY` to a file path, a `cdktf.log` file with all logs will be written.

## Troubleshooting

- Find out if the error is during synth or during execution
- Find the construct that is causing the error during synth
- Find the terraform resource and its construct that is causing the error during execution

## Common problems

### CDKTF CLI and library are on different versions

- `cdktf debug` to the rescue

## What to do if nothing helped

- CDKTF Slack
- Create a GH issue
